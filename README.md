# 7.-Arrays-and-Strings

# Arrays and Strings in CPP
Aim: To study and implement C++ Arrays and Strings.

Tools Used: VS Code or Programiz online cpp compiler.

# Theory
## Arrays in CPP
An array in C++ is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in consecutive memory locations. Elements are accessed using an index starting from 0, allowing fast access. The size of an array is fixed at the time of creation, making it less flexible.  Arrays are commonly used to store and process multiple values efficiently.

```
data_type array_name[size];
```

## Strings in CPP
A string in C++ is a sequence of characters used to store text. It can be created as a character array or using "string" data-type directly. Strings are more flexible because it allows easy operations like adding, conactenating, comparing, and finding length. Unlike arrays, strings can change size dynamically. Strings are commonly used for storing and processing text in programs.

```
string string_name=" ";
    //or
string string_name;
```


## Experiments and Algorithms

### 7.1 Printing Array Elements
**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize the array with given elements.
2. Loop through each element in the array.
3. Print each element sequentially.

---

### 7.2 To Find Number in a Given Array
**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize the array and the target number.
2. Loop through each element of the array.
3. Compare each element with the target number.
4. If a match is found, print the index or position.
5. If not found, print a suitable message.

---

### 7.3 Sum and Average of Elements
**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize the array with numbers.
2. Initialize a sum variable to 0.
3. Loop through each element and add it to sum.
4. Calculate the average as sum divided by the number of elements.
5. Print the sum and average.

---

### 7.4 Max Min Element
**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize the array.
2. Set two variables, max and min, to the first element.
3. Loop through the array:
   - If current element is greater than max, update max.
   - If current element is less than min, update min.
4. Print the max and min values.

---

### 7.5 Declaring Strings
**Algorithm:**
1. Declare a string variable.
2. Initialize it with some text.
3. Print the string value.

---

### 7.6 Concatenation of String
**Algorithm:**
1. Declare and initialize two string variables.
2. Use concatenation operator or function to join them.
3. Print the concatenated string.

---

### 7.7 Reverse String
**Algorithm:**
1. Declare and initialize the string.
2. Loop through the string from the last character to the first.
3. Append each character to a new string.
4. Print the reversed string.
